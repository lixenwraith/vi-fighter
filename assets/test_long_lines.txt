Line 1: Normal short line
Line 2: This is a very long line that exceeds the 80 character limit and should be truncated by the processing logic to fit within the game width constraints

Line 4: Short line again
Line 5: Yet another super duper extra long line with excessive content that needs to be truncated to match the game display requirements and prevent overflow issues
Line 6: Normal line
Line 7: Testing truncation with a line full of repeated characters: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
