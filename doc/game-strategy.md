# Strategy Guide

## Beginner Strategy (0-500 points)

**Goal**: Learn motions and build heat safely

### Priority Actions
1. **Focus on Green and Blue sequences** - All positive scoring
2. **Start with simple motions**: `h`/`j`/`k`/`l` for navigation
3. **Avoid red sequences** completely until comfortable
4. **Let decay happen** - Don't panic about the timer
5. **Chase gold sequences** aggressively - easiest way to build heat
6. **Collect nuggets** when they appear - free heat boost
7. **Don't use delete** (`x`, `dd`, etc.) - it resets heat

### Motion Practice
- Use `0` and `$` to jump to line edges
- Try `w` and `e` for word navigation
- Experiment with `f<char>` to find specific characters
- Use Tab to jump to nuggets (once you have 10+ score)

## Intermediate Strategy (500-2000 points)

**Goal**: Master heat management and boost activation

### Priority Actions

1. **Prioritize bright sequences** when heat is high (50+)
   - Bright Green/Blue at high heat = massive score

2. **Activate boost deliberately**:
   - Build heat to max
   - Scan screen for clusters of same color (Blue or Green)
   - Type same color repeatedly to extend boost

3. **Manage decay pressure**:
   - Watch decay timer in status bar
   - Clear Green (Dark) sequences before they become Red
   - Learn the 35-second rhythm at medium heat

4. **Use efficient motions**:
   - `gg`, `G`, `H`, `M`, `L` for screen jumps
   - `w`, `b`, `e` instead of repeated `l`/`h`
   - `/<pattern>` to find specific text

5. **Nugget strategy**:
   - Use Tab jump when score >= 10
   - Collect before decay reaches nugget
   - +10% heat can activate boost or extend it

### Heat Recovery
- If heat drops below 20, hunt for gold sequence
- Use boost to quickly rebuild from mistakes
- Collect nuggets for consistent heat gains
- Balance aggression (high heat) with sustainability

## Advanced Strategy (2000+ points)

**Goal**: Survive extreme decay pressure and maximize multipliers

### 1. Color Commitment During Boost

- Mentally note which color triggered boost (Blue or Green)
- Scan 2-3 sequences ahead for same color
- Navigate to next same-color target BEFORE finishing current sequence
- Aim for 5+ boost extensions (2.5+ seconds of boost time)

### 2. Dynamic Heat Management

**Heat Zones**:
- **70-90% heat**: Optimal zone - high scoring, manageable decay (15-20s)
- **100% heat**: Dangerous - 10s decay, only worth it with boost active
- **30-50% heat**: Safe zone - 35-45s decay, recovery period

### 3. Sequence Triage (What to Type When)

**Immediate Priority**:
- Gold sequences (10s timeout)
- Green (Dark) near decay timer (about to become Red)
- Red sequences when score is low

**High Priority**:
- Bright sequences when heat >70
- Nuggets before decay reaches them

**Medium Priority**:
- Normal sequences
- Blue (Dark)

**Low Priority**:
- Dark sequences
- Red (Dark) that will decay away

### 4. Decay Timing Exploitation

- Note decay timer when it appears (e.g., "Decay: 35.2s")
- Calculate time to next decay during typing
- Save Bright sequences for after decay (they refresh to normal)
- Clear Dark sequences just before decay to avoid color change

### 5. Advanced Motion Efficiency

- Chain motions: `3w` then `2e` instead of counting characters
- Use `{` and `}` to navigate between sequence blocks
- Search (`/`) for rare characters to jump across screen
- `go` to reset to top-left when screen gets chaotic

### 6. Score Optimization

- Never type Dark sequences at low heat (<20) - poor return
- Type Bright sequences ONLY at 70+ heat (×3 multiplier = 210+ points)
- Clear Red sequences immediately if score <1000 (big percentage loss)
- Let Red (Dark) decay away instead of typing (no heat reset)

### 7. Endurance Tactics

- Maintain 50-80% heat for sustainable play
- Use gold sequences as "panic buttons" for heat recovery
- Accept small score hits to avoid heat resets
- Take calculated risks: typing one Red to clear screen space

### 8. Nugget Management

- Tab jump to nugget when:
  - Decay timer < 5 seconds (nugget at risk)
  - Heat < 50% (need boost, worth the 10 score cost)
  - Screen overcrowded (quick navigation)
- Let nugget spawn naturally when:
  - Decay timer > 20 seconds (safe)
  - Heat already near max (nugget won't help much)
  - Currently on boost streak (don't interrupt)

## Performance Under Pressure

### At 10-Second Decay (100% Heat)

- Prioritize staying alive over scoring
- Type ONLY Bright sequences (maximum return on time)
- Keep boost active at all costs (need +2 heat to maintain)
- Consider letting some Green decay to Red, then ignore Red (Dark)
- Gold sequences become critical for momentary relief
- Tab jump to nuggets for quick heat maintenance

### Recovery from Heat Reset

1. Don't panic - decay slows down at low heat (60s intervals)
2. Locate gold sequence if present (instant recovery)
3. Locate nugget and Tab jump if score allows
4. Type 2-3 Bright sequences to build heat to 30-40 quickly
5. Re-assess situation: Do you chase max heat again or stabilize?

## Boost Mastery

### Maximizing Boost Duration

1. Before reaching max heat, scan screen for color clusters
2. If more Blue sequences visible, type Blue to trigger boost
3. If more Green sequences visible, type Green
4. Once boost active, navigate to next same-color target during typing
5. Use `f<char>` to quickly find same-color characters on current line

### Boost Decision Matrix

- **Blue on screen > Green**: Trigger boost with Blue, commit to Blue
- **Green on screen > Blue**: Trigger boost with Green, commit to Green
- **Equal amounts**: Choose color with brighter sequences (higher multipliers)

## Gold Sequence Tactics

### When to Chase Gold

- Heat below 30 (urgent heat recovery)
- Just made a mistake and heat reset to 0
- About to lose boost and need max heat again
- High-pressure situation (10s decay, many Red sequences)

### When to Ignore Gold

- Heat already at 90%+ and boost active
- Only 1-2 seconds remaining on timeout (not enough time)
- Currently maintaining 5+ boost extensions (momentum too valuable)

### Gold Typing Tips

- Use `/` search for first 2-3 characters if far from cursor
- Gold sequences are always 10 characters - muscle memory the rhythm
- No heat/score during typing, so type quickly without worry
- Tab jump to nugget after completing gold for extra heat boost

## Screen Reading

### Visual Patterns to Recognize

- **Decay warning**: Green (Dark) sequences = 1 decay from becoming Red
- **Safe to ignore**: Red (Dark) sequences = will disappear next decay
- **High value**: Clusters of Bright sequences at high heat
- **Boost opportunity**: 3+ same-color sequences in close proximity
- **Nugget urgency**: Decay timer < 5 seconds, nugget in decay path

### Color Vision at a Glance

- **Bright**: Lightest shade, crisp text
- **Normal**: Medium shade, clear text
- **Dark**: Darkest shade, still readable

### Heat Bar Colors (Top Bar)

- Red/Orange (0-30%): Low heat, safe zone, slow decay
- Yellow/Green (30-60%): Medium heat, balanced play
- Cyan/Blue (60-90%): High heat, high scoring, faster decay
- Purple/Pink (90-100%): Maximum heat, extreme pressure, boost ready

## Risk Management

### When to Type Red Sequences

- Your score is very low (< 500) - percentage impact is small
- Red is blocking path to high-value Bright sequence
- Screen is overcrowded (>70% full) - need to clear space
- Red is Bright level and your heat is low (paradox: penalty, but you're resetting soon anyway)

### When to Avoid Red

- Heat is high (50+) - you'll lose valuable momentum
- Score is high (2000+) - big point penalties hurt
- Red is Dark level - will disappear next decay (just wait)
- Currently on boost streak (red breaks boost)

## Muscle Memory Development

### Practice These Patterns

- `i` [type sequence] `ESC` `w` `i` - Word-by-word flow
- `/<text>` `Enter` `i` [type] `ESC` - Search-type-exit
- `gg` → scan → `G` → scan - Full screen assessment
- `f<char>` `i` [type] `ESC` - Find-type on current line
- `Tab` `i` [type] `ESC` - Jump-collect nugget

### Speed Drills

- Navigate to 10 different sequences using only `w`/`b`/`e` (no `hjkl`)
- Complete one gold sequence in under 5 seconds
- Maintain boost for 3+ seconds (7+ character extensions)
- Type 20 characters without heat reset
- Tab jump to nugget and collect in under 2 seconds
